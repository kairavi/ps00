    ; (f->c 32)  => 0
    ; (f->c 100) => 37.77777777777778

Ex 4: Define a function called tip that takes two arguments, a number representing the amount of a bill in dollars, and a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the percentage of tip one wants to give (e.g. 0.15 = 15%). tip should return the amount of the tip in dollars. The contract, purpose statement, and examples of tip are the following:
    ; tip : NonNegNumber Number[0.0,1.0] -> Number

Ex 8: The area included in a circle of radius r is given by the formula pi * r^2. Using the interaction window of DrRacket as a calculator, compute the area included in circles of radius 1, 5, and 7.

Ex 9: Find out what the operator remainder does by typing it in the definitions window, highlighting it, and pressing F1.
Try applying remainder on some examples to make sure you understand what it does. (what is its difference with modulo?)
Define a predicate even? that takes a number as an argument and returns true if this number is divisible by 2, and false otherwise. (You will probably need to use remainder or something similar in the implementation of even?.)
